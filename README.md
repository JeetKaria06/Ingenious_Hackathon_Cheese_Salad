## [ Connect ]

People in this pandemic have become so self centered and to increase social interaction among people or even to match you with someone with same taste of movies/books as you. This will help in increasing user's social well being. People will be able to step out of their depressed lives and live a joyful and happy life and can even interact with them, hang out with them, and even can go on a date, or even plan a trip or even meet their true soul partners.

## Rough Road Map

--> User Registration/Login <br>--> Common polls and multiple choice question answers to collect the preference of their individuals taste (help to build dataset) <br>--> Calculation of similarity index by correlation or clustering <br>--> Recommend them on their feed <br>--> Allowed to make them friends <br>--> Messaging (chat)

## Inspiration

In Japan, more people died from suicide last month than from Covid in all of 2020. And this is an alarming message to all the countries of this planet that social interaction and social well-being is still the most important aspect of human life. And to decrease depression in the minds of people and allowing them to interact with people of their own interests of books and movies, we have designed this platform which allows users to increase their social well-being.

And this inspired us to design this and connect people and hence the name "CONNECT" was born.

## What it does?

- It allows users to login and register on the platform. 
- After registration, it asks users for its interests in domains of books and movies like action, drama, romance, etc.
- After collecting user's preferences on genres of books and movies, it recommends them the people who are already on the platform and have similar interests.
- It shows people from the most matching to the least matching according to their tastes in books and movies based on their genres.
- After seeing recommendations, user can see different profiles and can also access it's instagram or facebook account and chat with them.

## Challenges we ran into

- The first challenge was finding similarity among users. We first tried implementing clustering and finding optimal number of clusters which will allow us to recommend same group people. But after getting insights from the mentor, we found that we were in the totally wrong direction and it was more of a recommendation problem. So, we started implementing content based filtering.


## Accomplishment that we're proud of

- We are proud to convert our idea into reality through this platform and it is almost working as per our expectations.
- Designing recommendation system was all new to us and we aced doing it and that too for the first time.

## What we learned

- We learnt many ways of deploying ML models to cloud based service and even deploying it.
- We also learnt some concepts of ML from the great mentors who were so keen to help.

## What's next for

- Next can be improvising recommendation algorithm and recommending more useful results.
- Also, we can increase the scope of data from just genre to almost everything which includes even the daily life things.
- Also, increaing platform's scalibility and even providing fuctionality of creating communities.

## Built With
- Python's Django framework
